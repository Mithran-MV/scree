# Scree

**A survey map of how you get liquidated.**

Every lending app reduces your risk to a single number: *"liquidated at $3,434."*
That number is a scalar standing in for a field, and it is most wrong exactly
when it matters. Scree renders the field.

## The map

| Axis | Meaning |
|---|---|
| left to right | price of your primary collateral, -60% to +60% of spot, log scale |
| bottom to top | **dwell** — how long price has continuously stayed at or below that level, 0 to 30 days |
| elevation | health factor minus one, minimised across every lending deployment you borrow from |
| sea level | liquidation |

High ground is safe. The coastline is where you die. The dashed line is a
**fold**: the price at which the deployment closest to killing you hands over to
a different one. No dashboard shows you that line, because a dashboard has one
row per protocol and nowhere to put the boundary between them.

## Why the ground has shape

Each position moves with price in one direction only. Supply ETH and borrow
stablecoins and you are **long**: price up is safer. Borrow ETH against
stablecoins and you are **short**. In `src/core/kernel.ts`:

```
HF(P, t) = ((a·P + c) · exp(rs·t)) / ((u·P + v) · exp(rb·t))
```

The derivative of that with respect to `P` has numerator `a·v − u·c`, which
carries no `P` at all. So a single position is monotone in price everywhere and
can never turn around. **All structure on the map comes from which position is
lowest**, not from any one of them bending.

Which means:

- A book that is entirely long renders an honest **ramp**. One shoreline, no
  ridge, no pass. The interface says so rather than drawing creases that are
  not there.
- A book holding **both signs** has one position that kills you on the way down
  and another on the way up. Between them is a ridge, and the highest point on
  it is the **pass** — the best health this book can reach at any price.

For two pure legs the ridge sits exactly at the geometric mean of the two
liquidation prices, and the crest is `sqrt(upper/lower) − 1`. That closed form
is in `src/core/bracket.ts` and it reports when it does *not* hold, because an
affine leg shifts the ridge off the mean.

## The geometry gate

It is easy to write a renderer that draws convincing creases over terrain that
is really a smooth ramp. `npm run gate` measures the actual raster and fails the
build when the drawing and the measurement disagree.

```
  wallet shape               MIXED
  binders                    3
  fold lines (8-connected)   2
  basins                     2
  pass                       $4,165.43
  pass elevation             0.160576
  boundary pass              true
  rises with price on        68.997% of steps
  crest drift over dwell     1.00 px
  lower shore drift          0.56 px
  upper shore drift          0.24 px

  verdict                    TOPOGRAPHY
```

## Honest limits

- **The dwell axis moves the terrain very little.** Over the full 30 days the
  shorelines shift 0.56 and 0.24 pixels on a 320-pixel axis. That is interest
  accrual and nothing else, and accrual is slow. The gate prints the number
  every run. The map does not sell the bend.
- **Two axes only.** One asset's price and how long it stayed there. Everything
  else the wallet holds is held constant, and collateral in a third volatile
  asset is badged on screen rather than quietly folded in.
- **The registry is a subset.** A map drawn from four of seven sources is still
  worth reading, but only because it names the three that did not answer.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The page loads a reference book with no configuration, so the map works before
any key is set. To survey a real address, set a gateway key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in GRAPH_API_KEY
npm run verify:subgraphs     # resolve every registry id before trusting it
```

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | development server |
| `npm test` | the full suite |
| `npm run gate` | measure the terrain and fail on a flat map |
| `npm run typecheck` | types |
| `npm run verify:subgraphs` | resolve every subgraph id against the gateway |

## What it will never ask for

Scree reads public positions. It does not request a token approval, hold a key,
or move anyone's funds. Where a defence policy is armed, the system returns an
action and a size; executing it stays the owner's own transaction.
